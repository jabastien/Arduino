/* My todo's

X - chreat this file

2 - finish start/init screens
    X r1.1
    X r2.1
    X r3.1
    
    X shunt
    X reference

    X switch
    X trim
    X menu
    
    = turn display bytes (01100011) as a return from Display.cpp
    
    = joystick range
      -
      -
      -
      -

    = control check

  - Try UNION for xxx.xx

  
    
3 - build menus
    = Trans
    = Model
    = System

4 - u8/s8 number display
  - can we use sprintf instead of role your own

5 - create key/volt display

6 - analog range for sticks (min/mid/max)

7 - collect var volts and test voltage

8 - transmit data
  
  - packets.h or common.h for transmit structs.

9 - why tps < 144 (was +300)
    = 1 bit  (1) per loop
    = 2 bits (1) % mod   (0-7 collect, 8 calculate, 9 tx)
 
10 - receiver to PC

X - need a 5.0 zener diode for VRef (using post diode input voltage 6-12v)
  http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode_7.html

 - See what can be made a generic methods
  
 - black box receiver to show data
 
 - black box channel scanner

11 - math & alarms
      = min FPS > 120
      = bat volts > 6.0v  

12 - alarms class?

13 - makes switches as LMH (requires 2 bits).
